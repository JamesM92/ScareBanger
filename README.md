# ScareBanger
The ScareBanger is intended to be an all around arduino breakout board, intended primarily for use with relay boards in haunted house prop control using the octobanger gui prop control software. 

It is desigend to connect directly to sainsmart 4/8 ch  or HiLetGo 1/2/4/8 ch relay boards to reduce the need for wiring. While providing access to the pins needed for I2C, SPI, RX/TX, interrupt, and analog pins that may be needed for more advanced projects.



Features  
  -5.5mmx2.5mm barrel jack connector for 12V power supply.  
  -screw terminals for 3.3V, 5V, and 12V power to connect to peripheral devices.  
  -All pluggable connections are verticcal to reduce the side space needed when placing board inside a project box.  
  -The board has a RJ45 8p8c connector that allows connection to +12V power, RX/TX lines and reset pin for serial communication.  
  -Sainsmart Relay board connection to 4ch / 8ch using 6 pin / 10 pin female headers  
  -HiLetGo Relay board conenctions 1ch/2ch/4ch/8ch using 5mm spaced right angle headers.
